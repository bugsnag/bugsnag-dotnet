## Release Guidelines

If you're a member of the core team, follow these instructions for releasing
bugsnag-dotnet.

### First-time setup

### Every time

* Compile new features, enhancements, and fixes into the CHANGELOG.
* Update the project version using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).
  Specifically:

  > Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
  >
  > 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  > 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
  >    manner, and
  > 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  >
  > Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
  > extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

* Commit and push your changes
* Add a git tag with the new version of the library
